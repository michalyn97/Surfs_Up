# Surfs_Up

### Purpose of Analysis
The purpose of the analysis is to provide data to my client W.Avy on the temperatures for the months of June and December in Oahu,
in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop is sustainable year round.

### Analysis
What I discovered is there is not much of a difference between the temperatues from the months of June and December
--Temperature highs were consisent in June and December ranging from 83 to 85 degrees.
--Temperatures lows were also consistent for both months with a < 10 degree variance.

--With an average temperature of > 70 degrees, I can safely assume that the ice cream shop may be a success.   

### Summary
Hawaii is a great place to live year round and it appears that opening a seasonal store such an ice cream shop may prove to be a profitable idea
based upon our data.
In the future, we may want to gather data on the precipitation for the Spring months and how that may affect the shop as wwll as temperatures for those months.
